\textit{The EBNF notation is a very usefull technique to descripe the grammar of a programming language. The use of regular expressions makes it possible to do left factorization, elimination of left recursion, and substitution of non-terminal symbols in a convenient way.\\ \indent
In our semantics we use the environment-store model to store variables. This model consist of the variable environment, where variables are referenced, and a store function, which uses the reference to find the value of the variable.\\ \indent
We use big-step operational semantics to descipe our semantics, which has a one to one mapping of the transistion.}
