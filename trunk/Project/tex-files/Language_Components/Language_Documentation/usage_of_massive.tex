The first declared must always be the \textit{main} function. MASSIVE will not function without this function, as every bit of code goes into this function.
The main function is declared as follows:

\begin{source}{How to declare the main funcion in MASSIVE}{}
main()
{
		/* Entire program code */
}
\end{source}

There are 2 different loops in our language, the for-loop and the while-loop. The while-loop is written the following way:
\begin{source}{While-loop}{}
while(/* Expression */)
{
		/* Code */
}
\end{source}

The for-loop can be written in the following way:
\begin{source}{For-loop}{}
for(num i = 0; /* Some Expression */; i = i + 1)
{
		/* Code */
}
\end{source}

Declaring variables can be done as long as the assigned value matched the datatype selected. Only three datatypes exist in MASSIVE, and can be declared as follows

\begin{source}{Variable assignment}{}
num count = 42;
string text = "hello world";
bool logicoperator = true;
\end{source}

Besides declaring variables, they and also be used in the language, or in mathematical expressions. Below is examples of all the mathematical expressions useable in MASSIVE. The parser will not be able to compile if any redundant parenthises are used.

\begin{source}{}{}

num numberOne = 1;
num result = 0;
num number = 42;

result = ((((number * 55)/)+number)-55)

\end{source}

In MASSSIVE language we have some default classes, these can be assigned using the following code:
\begin{source}{Object assignment}{}
new agent testAgent([name as string], [rank as num]);
new squad testSquad([name as string]);
new team testTeam([name as string], [color as hex code as string]);

testSquad.Add(testAgent
testTeam.Add(testAgent);
\end{source}

There are 2 statements in MASSIVE language, the \texttt{if}-statement and the \texttt{else}-statement. The \texttt{else}-statement can only be used if it follows an \texttt{if}-statement. Below is an example of the if statement used along with all the logical operators.

\begin{source}{Statements}{}
num testNumber = 10;
bool boolean = true;

if(testNumber == 20)
{
		/* Code */
}
if(testNumber =< 20)
{
		/* Code */
}
if(testNumber => 20)
{
		/* Code */
}
if(testNumber != 20)
{
		/* Code */
}
if(boolean == false)
{
		/* Code */
}
else
{
		/* Code */
}
\end{source}

When all the code has been written it can be run through the compiler, and it will generate an XML-file with the data entered.
