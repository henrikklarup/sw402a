\textit{In order to give the reader a top-down understanding of our product, we find that it is very important that the reader understands basic concepts of compiling. In this chapter we will explain core concepts and ideas as to how to compile written code into executeable code. This section will describe how the compiler components can be implemented, and there may be some differences between this and the way the components are actually implemented in this project.}
