\textbf{Lille ide til future work, gore det muligt at kore teams og squads igennem et for loop, lidt som et array, pa den made kunne man nemt redigere agents}\\ \\
The purpose of the compiler is to provide data that can be used in our wargame. 
Currently this is achieved by compiling our language into C\# code, which then produces XML data when run. 
A more efficient way of doing it could be by compiling straight to XML, so a seperate file with C\# would not have to be generated, compiled and run.\newline
Currently, our compiler and wargame are also seperate, and the two could be integrated further by building them into one program, making for a more consistent experience. 
This would allow us to skip XML generation, and generate data directly to the wargame.\newline
Other improvements could be made to the language it self. 
For example are action patterns very limited in functionality right now, and introducing language constructs that would allow for conditional movements could make a big difference. 
Allowing users of the language to define their own encounters, like what would happen if an agent met an agent with three times as much rank, would also be a big improvement.
