\section{The Graphical User Interface}
The user interface is made as a windows form application. With Visual Studios designer tools it is simple to make a nice design with buttons, panels, and windows just the way you want.\\
   The main idea of the design of the user interface is that there should be only a few buttons, the user should not spend a lot of time figuring out what all the buttons do. Furthermore we have designed the interface so the main structure looks like other popular strategy computer games (see \ref{pic:red_alert} and \ref{pic:coc} in appendix). We have done this to make the application easy to learn how to use.
	
\subsection*{Game Start Settings}
When the game is started, a dialog box is shown where one can choose the size of the \text{war zone}. We have chosen to have three fixed grid sizes, because of the way we draw the grid \ref{sec:drawing}.\\
   The functions of the dialog box is:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{Small, Medium, Large} radio buttons - select one to choose the grid size.
	\item \textit{Start} button - starts the game.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Game Interface Functions}
The functions of the game interface is:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{War zone} - contains the grid on which the war game unfolds.
	\item \textit{Agents} - the agents of the different teams (here with a 4-player game setup).
	\item \textit{Command center} - here the user types the commands to navigate the agents around the grid.
	\item \textit{Stats field} - shows the stats of a selected agent.
	\item \textit{Agents left} - shows how many agents are left on the teams.
	\item \textit{Combat log} - contains a combat log on who killed who in fights between agents.
	\item \textit{Command list} - contains the list of available commands the user can type in the \textit{command center}.
	\item \textit{MousePos grid} - shows the grid point of the mouse position.
	\item \textit{Execute} button - executes the typed in command in the \textit{command center}.
	\item \textit{End turn} button - ends the turn and gives the turn to the next player.
	\item \textit{Reset game} button - sets up a new game.
	\item \textit{Quit game} button - closes the game.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Drawing the Grid and Agents}
\label{sec:drawing}
The drawing of the grid and agents, is done using GDI+ (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533798(v=vs.85).aspx) which makes it possible to draw graphic on the screen. A usercontrol is added to eliminate the flickering GDI+ normally creates on windows forms, this is done with the help of double buffering.
We only use GDI+ graphics inside the usercontrol DBpanel, and make sure we draw things in the correct order, as we draw the pixels untop of each other. The first thing drawn is the background, which in our case is green, with the black gridlines on top of it, to create the game grid. Next the agents are drawn, one after the another.
The agents start posistions are calculated by the following algorithem:
