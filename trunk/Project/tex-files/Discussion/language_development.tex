\section{Compiler language}
We decided early on to develop our compiler in C\#, because it is a language we have a lot of experience with, and the object oriented paradigm is helpful in developing a compiler that uses an abstract syntax tree. 
There were problems managing reference types in C\# though. 
Reference types are the kinds of objects that when created refer to an existing object in memory rather than creating a new instance of the object. \newline
Several bugs occurred due to difficulty in anticipating when something is a referenced type as opposed to a seperate object. \newline
It might therefor have been beneficial to develop the compiler in a language like Haskell, which uses the functional paradigm. 
This is because purely functional languages do not allow side effects in their functions, meaning that existing data is not altered. 
Haskell is one such language\cite{misc:haskell}, where new data is created and the alterations are applied to, so reference types are of no concern.
