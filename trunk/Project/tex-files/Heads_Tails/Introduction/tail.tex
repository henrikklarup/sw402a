\textit{Our problem statement focus on how one can make a compiler and a language optimized for MASes. We have gained some background knowledge on multi agent systems (MAS), agent oriented languages (AOL) and language processors. A MAS uses agents to simulate some sort of scenario, where the agents strive to achieve a goal. One example of such systems is NetLogo\cite{misc:netlogo}. AOLs are a type of languages developed specific for creating these MASes.\\ \indent
The MAS we develop is a turn-based wargame, where the user has the opportunity to define the agents and behaviors with our language, and then play the game in our wargame environment.}
