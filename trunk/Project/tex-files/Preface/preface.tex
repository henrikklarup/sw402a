\chapter*{Preface}
This report is written in the fourth semester of the software engineering study at Aalborg University in the spring 2011.
\\
\\
The goal of this project is to acquire knowledge about fundamental principles of programming languages and techniques for description and translation of languages in general. Also a goal is to get a basic knowledge of central computer science and software technical subjects with a focus on language processing theories and techniques.\\ \indent
  We will achieve these goal by designing and implementing a small language for controlling a multi agent system in the form of a wargame. We are using Visual Studio and C\#, because we have used these tools in earlier semesters and are used to the C\# syntax.
	\\
	\\
	The report is written i \LaTeX, and we have used Google Docs and TortoiseSVN for revision control.

Source code examples in the report is represented as follows:
\begin{source}{This is a sorce code example}{}
if (spelling.ToLower().Equals(spellings[i]))
	{
		this.kind = i;
		break;
	}
\end{source}

We expect the reader to have basic knowledge about object oriented programming and the C\# language.
