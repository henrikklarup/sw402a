\chapter*{Preface}
This report is written in the fourth semester of the software engineering study at Aalborg University in the spring 2011.

The goal of this project is to acquire knowledge about fundamental principles of programming languages and techniques for description and translation of languages in general. Also a goal is to get a basic knowledge of central computer science and software technical subjects with a focus on language processing theories and techniques \textbf{ref. to study regulation}.\\
  We are going to achieve these goal by designing and implementing a small language for controlling a multi agent system in the form of a wargame. We are going to use Visual Studio and C\#, because we have used these tools in earlier semesters and are used to the C\# syntax.
