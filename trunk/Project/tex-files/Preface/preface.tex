\chapter*{Preface}
This report is written in the fourth semester of the software engineering study at Aalborg University, spring 2011.
\\
\\
The goal of this project is to acquire knowledge about fundamental principles of programming languages and techniques to describe and translate programming languages in general. Another goal is to get a basic knowledge of central computer science and software technical subjects with a focus on language processing theories and techniques.\\ \indent
  We will achieve these goals by designing and implementing a language optimized for controlling a multi agent system in the form of a wargame, which we call \textit{MASSIVE} - \textbf{M}ulti \textbf{A}gent \textbf{S}imulation \textbf{S}ystem \textbf{I}n \textbf{V}irtual \textbf{E}nvironment. The product have been written entirely in C\# using Visual Studio, this have been done because Visual Studio have a great framework to help develop interfaces. Since its easy to create interfaces with the Visual Studio framework, there have been more time to create the more important part of the project.

Source code examples in the report is represented as follows:
\begin{source}{This is a sorce code example}{}
if (spelling.ToLower().Equals(spellings[i]))
	{
		this.kind = i;
		break;
	}
\end{source}

We expect the reader to have basic knowledge about object oriented programming and the C\# language.
