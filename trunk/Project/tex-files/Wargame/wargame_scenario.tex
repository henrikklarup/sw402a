\section{Wargame Scenario}
\label{sec:wargame}

The game can have up to four players, where some can be set to move in predefined patterns, so that one can get a feeling of playing against an artificial intelligence.\\ \indent
	When the wargame is initialized, the user chooses the size of the battle area, and the agents and teams are set up by the input of the generated XML-file \ref{agents_patterns}.\\ \indent
	The user can type his commands in the \textit{command center}, and execute them by pressing the \textit{Execute} button. When the user is done executing commands, he can end his turn by pressing \textit{End Turn}.\\ \indent
	The moves available for the user to make is \textit{up}, \textit{down}, \textit{left} and \textit{right} (one coordinate at a time), and it is also possible to make several moves with an agent, if you select the agent and type the coordinates you want the agent to move to.\\ \indent
  When a collision between agents from opposing teams occur, a random function is called, which decides which agent wins the fight, favoring the unit with the highest rank.

\subsection{Agents and Action Patterns}
\label{agents_patterns}

The XML-document, which is loaded when the game initialized, sets the up the teams with number of players, division into squads, and rank of the agents. Also the action patterns are set by the XML-document.
