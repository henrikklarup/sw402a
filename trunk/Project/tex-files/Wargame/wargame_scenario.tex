\subsection{Wargame Scenario}

The war game is initialized and the number of agents on the teams is chosen by the user. The first user types the first command, and clicks the button \textit{Execute} to execute the command. When the user is done making his draws, he ends his turn by pressing the \textit{End Turn} button.
   The moves available for the user to make is up, down, left and right (one coordinate at a time), and it is also possible to make several moves with an agent, if you select the agent and type the coordinates you want the agent to move to.
   When a collision between agents from opposing teams occur, a random function is called, which decides which agent wins the fight, favoring the unit with the highest rank.
