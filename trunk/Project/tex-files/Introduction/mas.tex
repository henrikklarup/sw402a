\chapter{Multi Agent System}
The purpose of a Multi Agent System (MAS) is to create scenarios in which independent and intelligent agents make self-interested decisions that help them, or the entire group of agents, to achieve a predefined goal or condition.\\


\indent In order to achieve this, a number of mechanisms are needed. First of all, need agents to be able to make decisions. This could be done randomly, however, for obvious reasons this would not produce very realistic results. In order to make smart decisions, agents, like people, need some kind of goal. These goals can be defined in a lot of different ways, one of which is to associate states with values, and make agents strive to be in a higher state. \\ %create valued states that the agents strive to be in, the higher the value, the better the state.\\
\indent One example could be a robot with a censor that feeds a binary input, 1 if it is warm and 0 if it is cold. If it is cold, the robot would be a the state "cold", which would have a lower value than the state "warm". If the robot then had the possibility to warm the room, it could decide to do this, in order to return to the state "warm", which is better because it has a higher value.\\


\indent Another way to implement goals is be introducing a rate of utilization of the robot, again, higher utilization is better. The utilization reward given to a robot performing a task could then be calculated based on expenses associated with the job, and opportunity cost of not being able to perform other actions while performing the current. Agents are typically selfish in this setup, meaning that they will only do things that benefit their own utilization, regardless of the utilization of other agents. This does not mean that they are not able to help each other, it means that they will only do so if it benefits all the agents performing the given task.
