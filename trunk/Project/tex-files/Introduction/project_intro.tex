\chapter*{Project Introduction}

There exist many different programming languages for different purposes, and in this report we have focus on multi agent wargame. In this project we are developing a language and compiler to generate code for a multi agent wargame. This leads to our problem statement:
\begin{center}
\line(1,0){400}
\end{center}
	\textit{How can we develop a programming language and compiler, optimized to control agents of a multi agent wargame?}
\begin{center}
\line(1,0){400}
\end{center}
To answer these questions we first need some background knowledge about multi agent systems, agent oriented languages, and the main idea with compilers and interpreters, which will be described in the first part of the report, together with a description of the multi agent system that we are developing.\\ \indent
In \textit{Design}, we describe the basics of languages and compilers.\\ \indent
In \textit{Implementation}, we explain how we have have done the implementation of the language, compiler and the multi agent system environment.\\ \indent
In the \textit{Discussion} we discuss some of our language development choices, and we conclude on the project as a whole.\\ \indent
In the \textit{Epilogue} we discuss what could be improved in future work, and the last part \textit{Appendix} contains other relevant material, such as our full language grammar.
