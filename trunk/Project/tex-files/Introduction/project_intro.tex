\chapter*{Project Introduction}

There exist many different programming languages for different purposes, an in this report we have focus on multi agent systems. In this project we are developing a language and compiler to generate code for a multi agent system. This leads to our problem statement:
\begin{center}
\line(1,0){400}
\end{center}
	\textit{How can a programming language and compiler, optimized to control logics of a multi agent wargame, be developed? How can one demonstrate this optimization?}
\begin{center}
\line(1,0){400}
\end{center}
To answer these question we first need some background knowledge about multi agent systems, agent oriented languages, and the main ideas with compilers and interpreters, which will be described in the first part of the report (introduction), together with a description of the multi agent system that we are developing.\\ \indent
In the next part, \textit{Tools}, we describe building block of languages and compilers.\\ \indent
In third part, \textit{Implementation}, we explain how we have have done the implementation of the language, compiler and the multi agent system environment.\\ \indent
In the \textit{Discussion} part we discuss some of our language development choices, and we conclude on the project as a whole.\\ \indent
In the \textit{Epilogue} part we discuss what could be improved in future work, and the last part \textit{Appendix} contains other relevant material, such as our full language grammar.
