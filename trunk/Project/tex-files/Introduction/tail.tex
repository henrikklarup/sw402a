\textit{Our problem statement focus on how one can make a compiler and a language optimized for MASes. We have gained some background knowledge on multi agent systems (MAS), agent oriented languages (AOL) and language processors. A MAS uses agents to simulate some sort of scenario, where the agents strive to achieve a goal. One example of such systems is NetLogo\cite{misc:netlogo}. AOLs are a type of languages developed specific for creating these MASes.\\ \indent
Compilers and interpreters are two types of translators, where a compiler has to translate the entire input before the result
can be used. An interpreter runs one instruction at a time from the input, thus enabling it to start utilizing the input when it is received.\\ \indent
