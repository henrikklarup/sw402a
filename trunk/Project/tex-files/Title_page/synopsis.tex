In this project we develop an agent oriented language and a high-level to high-level compiler. Our language can control agents in a multi agent wargame.\\ \indent
The language we develop (called \textit{MASSIVE}) is optimized for the wargame we develop. This becomes evident from a use case where we make a programming example in \textit{MASSIVE}. Also a goal was to make the language more simple, for example by reducing the number of types.\\ \indent
