In this project we will develop a multi agent system formed as a wargame. To do that we use C\# to make the wargame environment, and then we make our own language and compiler that will generate code to control the agents in the wargame.\\ \indent

In this project we will develop a multi agent system formed as a wargame. The wargame environment and user interface is made in C\#, and we will therfore make a high-level to high-level compiler that generates C\# code, based on code input from a programming language we develop. The code generated from our compiler will  make an XLM-document, which, when is given as input in the user interface, sets up teams, agents and behaviors for the wargame.\\
