A lot of multi agent systems have already been developed, and we will take a look at a few of them, to get an idea of how others have designed multi agent systems.\\

section{Net-Logo}
NetLogo is a popular and widespread MAS, ..... Udfyld gerne! ......\\
\indent NetLogo features a very easy programming language for creating both Agents and Environments, and also provides reletively easy ways of manipulating the cosmetics of the MAS-simulation. NetLogo has the advantages that even though the programming language is very easy to learn and write, it is also very feature rich, and can create MAS's that can simulate almost any possible scenario, right from advanced traffic scenarios to how many tadpoles will survive the first week of their lives.

\begin{NetLogo}{This is a NetLogo sorce code example}{}
to setup
  clear-all
  ask patches
    [ set pcolor (random colors) * 10 + 5
        if pcolor = 75  ;; 75 is too close to another color so change it to 125
          [ set pcolor 125 ] ]
  reset-ticks
end

to go
  ask patches [ set pcolor [pcolor] of one-of patches ]
  tick
end
