\section{Agent Oriented Language}
Creating all of these MAS' and the environment to go with them, using a traditional programming language, can, however, be rather difficult and tiresome. The need for programming skill both limits the amount of people able to create a MAS and prolongs the amount of time required from people who have the necessary skills.\\
\indent In order to overcome this problem, people have started to develop languages specifically designed to create MAS' and MAS-environments, these languages are called Agent Oriented Languages (AOL), and what they all have in common is added abstraction.
