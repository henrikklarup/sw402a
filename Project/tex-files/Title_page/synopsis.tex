In this project we will develop a high-level to high-level compiler and an agent oriented language, which can control agents in a multi agent system formed as a wargame. To do that we use C\# to make the wargame environment, and then we make our own language and compiler that will generate C\# code. When the generated code is run, it makes an XML file with data, which set up the agents in the wargame.\\ \indent
The language we develop (called \textit{MASSIVE}) is optimized for the wargame we develop. This becomes evident from the lines of code it takes to program the agents and action patterns in \textit{MASSIVE} versus in C\#. Also a goal was to make the language more simple, for example by reducing the number of types. For example we have implemented af single type, \texttt{num}, to cover the types \texttt{int}, \texttt{long}, etc. \\ \indent
