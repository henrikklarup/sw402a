In this project we will develop a multi agent system formed as a wargame. The wargame environment and user interface is made in C#, and we will therfore make a high-level to high-level compiler that generates C# code, based on code input from a programming language we develop. The code generated from our compiler will  make an XLM-document, which, when is given as input in the user interface, sets up teams, agents and behaviors for the wargame.\\
