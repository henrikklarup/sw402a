In this project, an agent oriented language is designed and implemented. The implementation is done via a high-level to high-level compiler. The language is specialized towards a concept that we call "multi agent wargame". This wargame gives the user the possibility to simulate programmed battle scenarios.\\ \indent
The language is designed using BNF and EBNF grammar, and implemented via abstract syntax trees and tree traversal. The implementation is described through a big step semantic.\\ 
\indent Furthermore we discuss the different aspects of the language and ways to improve it and then compare it to an object oriented language to determine the up- and downsides of this kind of specialized language.\\ 
\indent We arrive at the conclusion that the language meets the specifications
and our expectations, as it provides programmers with a framework to
specify strategic behaviors in simulated battles.
