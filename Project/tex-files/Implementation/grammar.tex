\section{Grammar}
The grammatics is the heart of a programming language. It is what difines the rest of the compilerbase and what every aspect of language is made of.
It is importeat when building the gramma for a language that one is clear of what every aspect of the gramma does. It is important that the language is not ambiguous, as this would could lead to misunderstanding in compile-time, and make wrong code.
To define the grammatics of a programming language, one needs to define the very basics of the language. First one must define which things should be allowed with the language, and which should not.
One of the things one should start defining is the diffrent types of the language. In our language we choose three types; num, string and bool. These will help define what is allowed in the language. Once these are defined, they can be broken up into even smaller parts, i.e. num is made up by digits or digits followed by the char '.' followed by digits, which in the gramma looks like this; number ::= digits | digits.digits.
Then this is again split into even smaller parts, taking digits defined as; digits ::= digit | digit digits. And then the last part, digit ::= 1|2..9|0. This is done for every type if the language.
