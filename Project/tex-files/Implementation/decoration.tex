\subsection{Decoration}
The decoration of the abstract syntax tree can be a large task, depending on how many checks that need to be done. 
Therefor, instead of having just one visitor do all the decoration, we have several. \newline
The first one is the TypeAndScopeVisitor, which visits every node of the abstract syntax tree, and checks if the types and scopes of variables in the code are correct.\newline
Therefor, this is where type safety is enforced in the compiler. 
This works simply by taking the type of the variable's token and comparing it to the values it is being used with. \newline
The scope checking is a little more complex. 
We want to make sure that variables are not used outside of their scopes, which is done with the IdentificationTable class. 
This class contains a list of declared variables, the current scope and methods for entering and retrieving variables and methods for changing the scope.\newline
Every time a scope is exited, every variable that was declared inside that scope is deleted from the list. 
This way, the list will only contain the variables that are accessible from the current scope, so long as the scopes are updated correctly.

\begin{source}{A block is visited, and the scope is opened and closed respectively.}{}
internal override object visitBlock(Block block, object arg)
		{
        IdentificationTable.openScope();
        ...
        IdentificationTable.closeScope();

        return null;
     }
\end{source}
