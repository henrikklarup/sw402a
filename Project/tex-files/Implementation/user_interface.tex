\section{The Graphical User Interface}
The user interface is made as a windows form application. With Visual Studios designer tools it is simple to make a nice design with buttons, panels, and windows just the way you want.\\
The main idea of the design of the user interface is that there should be only a few buttons, så that the user should not spend a lot of time figuring out what all the buttons do. Furthermore we have designed the interface so that the main structure looks like other popular strategy computer games \textbf{(ref. and screenshots)}.
