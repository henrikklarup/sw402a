\textit{Compilers and interpreters are two types of translators, where a compiler has to translate the entire input before the result can be used. An interpreter runs one instruction at a time from the input, thus enabling it to start utilizing the input when it is received.\\ \indent
  The scanner produce a stream of tokens which it has recognized in the source program. The parser then recognize the phrase structure of the token stream, and prints an abstract syntax tree.\\ \indent
  To decorate the AST we use the visitor pattern. There are a visitor for type and scope checking, one for input validation, one that checks for unused variables, and one for code generation.
This design pattern is specifically used for traversing data structures and executing operations on objects without adding the logic to that object beforehand.\\ \indent
  Our compiler can catch errors after every parsing of the code. This is convenient for the programmer when he needs to debug the code he writes.\\ \indent
  The user interface is implemented using windows form application and C\#. We structure the interface so that it has the  same basic structure as other strategic computer games, which should make it easier to learn to use.}
