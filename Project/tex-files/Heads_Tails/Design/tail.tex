\textit{The EBNF notation is a very useful technique to describe the grammar of a programming language. The use of regular expressions makes it possible to do left factorization, elimination of left recursion, and substitution of non-terminal symbols in a convenient way.\\ \indent
In our semantics, we use the environment-store model to store variables. This model consist of the variable environment, where variables are referenced, and a store function, which uses the reference to find the value of the variable.\\ \indent
We use bigstep operational semantics to describe our semantics, which is a one to one mapping of the transition.\\ \indent
A program written in MASSIVE can contain while-loops, for-loops, variable assignments, object assignments and if commands.}
