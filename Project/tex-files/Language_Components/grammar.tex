\section{Grammar}
\label{sec:ebnf}

There are several ways the grammar of a language can be described. In this project we use BNF and EBNF, and those will be outlined in this section.\\
BNF (Backus-Naur Form) is a formal notation technique used to describe the grammar of a context-free language. There are several variations of BNF, for example EBNF (Extended BNF), which are used to describe the grammer of the language developed in this project.\\
The EBNF is a mix of BNF and regular expressions.

    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l |}
    \hline
     & Regular expression & Product of expression\\ \hline
    empty & $\varepsilon$ & the empty string\\ \hline
    singleton & $t$ & the string consisting of $t$ alone\\ \hline
    concatenation & 10C & the concatenation of any string generated by $X$ and any string generated by $Y$\\
    \hline
